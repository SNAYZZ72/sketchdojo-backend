Feature bold outlines with a slight gradient effect that adds depth to characters and environments. Emphasize expressive facial features and fluid body language, utilizing stylized proportions that maintain a balance between realistic anatomy and exaggerated expressions. Include dynamic panel layouts that guide the viewer's gaze smoothly through the story, with varied angles and perspectives to enhance the narrative flow.\n\n**Lighting and Atmosphere:**  \nCreate a neutral yet inviting atmosphere with soft, even lighting. Use a subtle gradient from warm to cool tones across the panel to evoke a sense of openness and tranquility. Ensure that the lighting source appears natural, casting gentle shadows that add dimension without overwhelming the scene. Add a slight atmospheric haze in the background to unify the elements and create a sense of depth.\n\n**Color Schemes and Composition:**  \nUtilize a harmonious color palette featuring pastel shades combined with bright accent colors to capture attention and maintain a cheerful mood. Soft blues, gentle greens, and light pinks should dominate the background, while characters can be dressed in more vivid colors to stand out. Compose the scene with a balanced distribution of elements, ensuring that the main character and focal points are centrally located, surrounded by complementary background elements that enrich the visual narrative without distracting from the central action.\n\n**Technical Artistic Details:**  \nIncorporate digital painting techniques to achieve a smooth texture, with a slight cel-shaded effect on characters to enhance their visibility against the background. Use layering techniques to build depth, ensuring that foreground elements pop while maintaining a soft focus on the background. Integrate subtle highlights and shadows to enhance three-dimensionality, particularly on characters' hair and clothing.\n\n**Visual Effects and Stylistic Elements:**  \nAdd stylistic elements such as motion lines or speed effects around characters to convey energy and action, especially in moments of movement. Consider incorporating sparkles or soft glows around objects of interest to draw the viewer's eye. Use simplistic icons or visual metaphors (like hearts or stars) to symbolize emotional states or reactions, subtly woven into the scene without cluttering the visual narrative.\n\nOverall, aim for a polished, engaging visual representation that reflects the vibrancy and emotional depth typical of webtoon storytelling while adhering to the specified neutral mood.", "image_url": "http://localhost:8000/static/generated_images/placeholder_20250622_201611.png"}, "image_url": "http://localhost:8000/static/generated_images/placeholder_20250622_201611.png"}, "input_data": {"prompt": "A magical school adventure with teenage wizards", "art_style": "webtoon", "num_panels": 4, "character_descriptions": [], "additional_context": "Webtoon ID: ea590974-0990-40f7-9465-20a9e0943cfc", "style_preferences": {}}, "metadata": {}}
