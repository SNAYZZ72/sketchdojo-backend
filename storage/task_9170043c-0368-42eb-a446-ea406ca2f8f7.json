The characters will feature large, expressive eyes and simplified facial features, allowing for a wide range of emotions. The linework should be smooth and consistent, with varying line thickness to add depth and interest, particularly in character details and environmental elements. Backgrounds will be semi-detailed, focusing on establishing the setting without overwhelming the characters, adhering to the common webtoon practice of foreground emphasis.\n\n**Lighting and Atmosphere:**\nThe scene is set in a neutral mood, meaning the lighting should be soft and diffused to create a calm, inviting atmosphere. Use a natural light source, such as sunlight filtering through trees or soft indoor lighting, to create gentle shadows that enhance the three-dimensionality of the characters and environment. The overall lighting should evoke a sense of tranquility, avoiding harsh contrasts but instead favoring a balanced illumination across the scene.\n\n**Color Schemes and Composition:**\nUtilize a harmonious color palette dominated by pastels and soft hues, such as light blues, soft pinks, and gentle greens, which help convey the neutral mood. The characters' clothing should reflect complementary colors to create visual interest without clashing. The composition should follow the webtoon format with a vertical panel layout, guiding the reader's eye from top to bottom, with the most important elements centered and slightly larger to draw attention, while background elements gradually taper off in scale.\n\n**Technical Artistic Details:**\nThe image should include a resolution suitable for high-quality display, approximately 300 DPI, ensuring crisp linework and color fidelity. Use vector graphics for character designs to maintain smooth lines during scaling. Textures should be subtly applied to clothing and backgrounds to add depth, such as a fabric texture for clothing and a light grain for natural elements.\n\n**Visual Effects and Stylistic Elements:**\nIncorporate stylized effects like soft glows around light sources and gentle gradients in the sky or background to add dimension and interest. Include motion lines or soft sparkles for any dynamic elements to enhance the storytelling aspect. Additionally, consider the use of panel borders that are slightly curved or ornate, aligning with the webtoon aesthetic, which can add a playful and engaging touch to the overall presentation.\n\nThis detailed description should effectively guide the AI in generating a visually appealing and cohesive webtoon image while keeping the core visual concept intact.", "image_url": "http://localhost:8000/static/generated_images/placeholder_20250622_201318.png"}, "image_url": "http://localhost:8000/static/generated_images/placeholder_20250622_201318.png"}, "input_data": {"prompt": "A magical school adventure with teenage wizards", "art_style": "webtoon", "num_panels": 4, "character_descriptions": [], "additional_context": "Webtoon ID: 5aa19c4f-1842-48b1-b731-2c8771be7f34", "style_preferences": {}}, "metadata": {}}
